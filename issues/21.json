Simulate each species' vocal system, then derive the parameters from microphone input.\r\n\r\nUsable for realtime-chat. Protects player privacy, serves as compression & enables cross-species modulation & voice imitation. Also good for streamers & machinima (#23).\r\n\r\nDoubles as simple input for lip sync. Thus needs to be integrated with the simulation (#19). The inverse integration enables localized damage to result in reduced speech capability.\r\n\r\nIn droids, the simulation is represented very clearly with chips, cables etc. For easier modding onboarding curve. And localized damage, for those classic distorted speech effects of damaged droids.","createdAt":"2022-07-07T21:15:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/mrwonko/TheseusJA/issues/21#issuecomment-1178240317","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDOAIyaz85GprJn","author":{"login":"mrwonko"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"With voice synthesis, we're not far from text-to-speech.
