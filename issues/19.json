Lightsaber dismemberment is popular.\r\n\r\nCould have realistic mode where lightsabers always cut through most materials (like flesh and bone), but that has extensive and somewhat disturbing gameplay and content implications.\r\n\r\nShould every lightsaber wound be fatal? Presumably not. Do NPCs (and players!) behave like the knight in Monty Python's Holy Grail as they continue to lose limbs? Do they run? Does it vary from character to character? Either way, procedural animation might be needed. Do we simulate organs and their destruction? That would open the interesting possibilities of cybernetic replacements, and NPCs returning with those in a don't-call-it-Nemesis-system (emergent stories) (#75).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand I don't want to simulate dangling entrails? But some will want to. Needs to be optional/customizable. I don't really want to encourage players to precisely butcher their enemies with brutal efficiency, at least not the humans? Though there is a bizarre appeal in learning and mastering the anatomy of your victims. And if I'm going to do rope physics for grappling hooks, I might as well use it for entrails… Could allow use of force to identify weak spots. I feel like I don't want to be the one to model all the veins to simulate blood splatter (thankfully lightsabers cauterise), but the systems could be general enough to allow players to implement that?\r\n\r\nSame system could be used for fuel lines etc. in vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe modelled organs and bones (and joints and muscles? Could use those for IK and deformation!) should be reusable across models of the same species. Should adjust automatically to shape of model, maybe with option to make manual changes as well?\r\n\r\nWould then have to teach NPCs to decide whether to aim for non-lethal wounds.\r\n\r\nSimulated organs also enable the classic \"kill the giant monster from the inside\" verb.","createdAt":"2021-11-12T23:29:09Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/mrwonko/TheseusJA/issues/19#issuecomment-967726238","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDOAIyaz846Flek","author":{"login":"mrwonko"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Liquid and smoke simulations as well as the sound engine could use the voxel system for geometry, too. One unified system.\r\n\r\nOnce liquids come into the mix, melting metal with lightsabers is not far off. Once that tech of there, it could also simulate blowtorches.\r\n\r\nBut not everything melts. Some things catch fire. But that in turn is a chemical reaction with oxygen from the air, and does not happen in a vacuum. And the fire produces carbon monoxide that suffocates the player and the fire. And suddenly we're talking about a full chemistry simulation. Oof?\r\n\r\nInteresting gameplay implications in melting. Could simulate smelting alloys. (Do I just want to build the next Factorio/Infinifactory/…?) Enables forging. And the Terminator ending. And horrific mutilation.\r\n\r\nApply similar hierarchical structure to chemistry simulation. E.g. simulate exothermal fuel reaction in vehicle engine, but simplify it to \"engine takes these inputs and produces these outputs\" until it's sliced open.\r\n\r\nOr just fudge it.
