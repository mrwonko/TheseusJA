{"body":"With realistic saber damage, enemies become much easier to defeat. We can make up for that with numbers, if we optimise performance sufficiently (simulation LODs?). There are many large-scale ground battles throughout Star Wars (e.g. Naboo, Geonosis, Kashyyyk, Hoth) that would be cool to see at scale.\r\n\r\nSomewhat at odds with the planned increased simulation fidelity.
