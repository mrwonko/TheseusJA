{"body":"Before I add new menu syntax in #32, build an in-game edit mode for menus.\r\n\r\nYou can enter edit mode at any time a menu is visible on-screen. It optionally pauses the game (if you're offline) and lets you interact with on-screen menus. You can also open other menus directly, though I first have to build a menu for that, so initially everything needs to be usable through the console for bootstrapping.\r\n\r\nYou can toggle between vanilla and various extensions, which are versioned and referenced in the extended menu file (.xmenu?). This way I can keep adding new menu features to my mod, and so can everybody else, and assets just declare what they need and clients can show an error if a feature is missing. I need to provide a reference implementation for that which is easy to integrate in vanilla, or at least a canonical vanilla integration (#64).\r\n\r\nRequire UI designers to provide a fallback legacy .menu version, if only to show \"this menu requires bla bla extension, more info here etc.\" to vanilla users.","closed":false,"comments":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"menu editor"}
