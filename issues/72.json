{"body":"Shader loading order is inverted (alphabetically lower pk3s take precedence), which annoyingly extends to mod folders, i.e. shaders in base/ take precedence over any in mod folders. Mods should be able to overwrite base shaders without interfering with other mods, but that would be a breaking change... Maybe make it optional?","closed":false,"comments":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"allow mods to override shaders"}
