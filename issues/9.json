{"body":"One large obstacle towards a LibreJA are the animations, and humanoid.gla in particular.\r\n\r\nIANAL, but I think motion capturing a human actor imitating the non-libre animations might be far enough removed.\\*\r\n\r\nAnd wouldn't it be cool to have tools for that in the game? I want to add VR anyway, so why not do VR Motion Capture? My VIVE already gives me head and hand tracking, add in a camera with depth capture and I could overlay my body in VR for reference, and track it, then play the original animation for reference and imitate it.\r\n\r\nWill benefit from, if not require, animation retargeting (#6). That would also enable performance capture\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\\* At least if they use a new skeleton. Which would not be compatible with existing playermodels? Could retarget animations to both libre and proprietary skeleton? #16 ","closed":false,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOAIyaz843lFT4","author":{"login":"mrwonko"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"For machinima, allow real-time VR camera operation, with optional steady shot, Dolly etc. Cutscenes, too.\r\n\r\nUseful for pre-vis for my movie projects, too!","createdAt":"2021-10-01T18:42:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/mrwonko/TheseusJA/issues/9#issuecomment-932467960","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDOAIyaz843lFdg","author":{"login":"mrwonko"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Besides direct motion capture, also allow puppeteering, real-time or keyframed.
