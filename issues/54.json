That way, the server can operate on a single timeline.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that in fighting games the most popular method is to roll back time to insert player inputs in the past, then replay the frames since then to adjust the present. I wonder how well this approach would work here, I want to experiment with rolling back time anyway. Could also simplify peer2peer?","closed":false,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOAIyaz85MrWIo","author":{"login":"mrwonko"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"I can be cheeky and call reversing time a \"retcon\".
