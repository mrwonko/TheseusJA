{"body":"Many of the single player levels in both Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy are frequently confusing. Try to improve the level design to make solutions easier to find:\r\n\r\n- ensure consistent textures to distinguish breakable and non-breakable surfaces (glass, grates etc.)\r\n- draw attention to important elements of environmental puzzles\r\n- retrofit force sight into Jedi Outcast as a hint system? (Show button-door-connections etc.)\r\n- possibly prevent players from backtracking away from a puzzle they need to solve\r\n\r\nOf course, this depends on having a level editor (see #19)","closed":false,"comments":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"overhauled vanilla campaigns"}
