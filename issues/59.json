{"body":"As mentioned in #20, I want Prey/Portal-style portals. Besides the physics changes required for smooth transition, I also want to improve the rendering to support recursive portal rendering through render-to-texture.","closed":false,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOAIyaz85PxcKx","author":{"login":"mrwonko"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"It would also be fun to combine it with #19 to slice objects apart if they only partially pass through a portal. Impractical, but fun. Would require safety borders around portals.\r\n\r\nOne-way portals are even worse. What happens if you turn around halfway through? Are you cut in half?\r\n\r\nUltimately, treating players as a point at the camera location will be muuuuch simpler. Until VR adds a second camera.\r\n\r\nAlso: I should come up with tech to explain portals. The material stimulation may drastically change the landscape around a portal, so a portal should probably not stay in place of the room it's in moves. So it needs to be tied to some kind of portal generator.","createdAt":"2022-12-05T23:35:48Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/mrwonko/TheseusJA/issues/59#issuecomment-1338360497","viewerDidAuthor":true}],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Portals"}
