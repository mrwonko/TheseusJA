{"body":"One potential way to have somewhat balanced multiplayer with all the new powerful abilities I want to add (climb, fly, grapple, jet-boots etc.) is to limit the number of them a player can use at once. Have players create an individual loadout of moves, like in God Hand.\r\n\r\nMake it an optional mode, for the full power fantasy a player should be able to acquire everything.\r\n\r\nThis would also enable an additional simpler(?) way of inputting these controls, by allowing each loadout slot to be bound to a corresponding key/button. This might be controller friendly?","closed":false,"comments":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"number":2,"title":"Animation & Movement","description":"","dueOn":null},"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"choose-your-own-moveset"}
