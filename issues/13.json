There are probably cool hybrid models for collaborating on tracks. You should definitely be able to monitor other players in real-time, and you can play along, but without sending your audio back. But you could conceivably daisy chain band members.\r\n\r\nI also like the idea of physically simulating music instruments (#19) and tweaking their sound in real-time using midi input, building formulas in a visual editor (#31) using physical properties, which can in turn procedurally generate the instrument model.","createdAt":"2023-02-10T21:14:35Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/mrwonko/TheseusJA/issues/13#issuecomment-1426355207","viewerDidAuthor":true}],"labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNDU1MTI1Nw==","name":"enhancement","description":"","color":"84b6eb"}],"milestone":{"number":5,"title":"Audio","description":"","dueOn":null},"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"MIDI support / Music Synthesis"}
