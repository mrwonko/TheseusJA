{"body":"I want to have the freedom to fundamentally change things in the engine.\r\n\r\nBut I want to enable other mods to be interoperable with me with little effort. I want to encourage others to adopt the new asset formats I introduce. For that, I need to make them easy to integrate.\r\n\r\nSo for each extension, it would be good to have a fork that shows how to integrate it into a reasonably-close-to-Vanilla codebase like OpenJK. I should provide the necessary adapters, if any.\r\n\r\nTogether with documentation, this could also provide a good starting point for people looking to get into JA source modding.","closed":false,"comments":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"projectCards":[],"projectItems":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"reference feature implementations"}
