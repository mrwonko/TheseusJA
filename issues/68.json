{"body":"I already touched on the idea of running parts of the game on a second device in #27. Taking that one step further, why not make it run in a browser? Add a special mode where the game acts as a web server serving itself as a web version, optionally providing UDP proxying to enable multiplayer.\r\n\r\nI was thinking about this in the context of showing my editors to other people, especially getting musicians to try future music tools (#13). With a web version, there's much less friction. (Can websites use midi?)\r\n\r\nBut another cool use case would be web admin panels for game servers. Again, the \"make everything work the same using simple building blocks\" principle enables a myriad of applications.","closed":false,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOAIyaz85RxxJv","author":{"login":"mrwonko"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Reflect the menu stack in the URL to allow for deep-linking, e.g. to editors or joining a server.
