{"body":"Event sourcing (#67) and the related multiplayer rewind (#54) help build an undo/redo stack. Applying that to a running game gives the ability to rewind time like in Prince of Persia: the Sands of Time.\r\n\r\nIn multiplayer, we might want to keep the time travel localised, or we'd never get anywhere. Time travel is safe if everyone who can observe it is traveling with you.\r\n\r\nSo we must limit the time travel distance, and then we can remember with whom you interacted in this past time window. Those must rewind with you, everyone else remains on their own timeline until they observe your rewriting and merge.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn't account for roaming patrols suddenly being off path and other inevitable conflicts between past and present. Time travel is more dangerous than you'd think.\r\n\r\nI'm just wondering how I can make it work in a multiplayer universe. How are players partitioned?\r\n\r\n\r\nCan be specialised into local bullet time.
